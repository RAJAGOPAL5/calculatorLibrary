## what is this ?

A simple arithmetic calculator is a program that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on numbers provided by the user.

## Features:

Addition: Adds two or more numbers together.
Subtraction: Subtracts one number from another.
Multiplication: Multiplies two or more numbers.
Division: Divides one number by another (ensuring the divisor is not zero).

## Installation:

To use the calculator library in your Node.js project, install it via npm:

Run `npm i twilight-calc`

## Usage

``
// Import the calculator module
const { add, subtract, multiply, divide } = require('twilight-software-package-calc');

// Use the calculator functions
console.log(add(5, 3)); // Output: 8
console.log(subtract(10, 4)); // Output: 6
console.log(multiply(2, 6)); // Output: 12
console.log(divide(8, 2)); // Output: 4
``

## API

add(a, b): Adds two numbers a and b.
subtract(a, b): Subtracts b from a.
multiply(a, b): Multiplies a by b.
divide(a, b): Divides a by b.


`Adjust the import statement (`require('twilight-software-packagecalc')`) and function calls (`add`, `subtract`, etc.) based on your library's actual structure.`


## Documentation and Examples:
Provide additional documentation, examples, and usage scenarios to help users understand how to integrate and use your calculator library effectively. Including code snippets, explanations, and sample inputs/outputs can be very helpful.


## Testing:
Consider adding tests for your library using testing frameworks like Jest, Mocha, or Jasmine. Provide instructions on how users can run these tests to ensure the correctness of your library.
